Initialize the Vault:

Initialization is the process by which Vault’s storage starts preparation to receive data.
Vault generates an in-memory master key and applies Shamir’s secret sharing algorithm to disassemble that master key into multiple keys. These keys are called “unseal keys”.
So to initialize the vault, first, we need to unseal the vault using the unseal keys.

exec into the pod  
-----------  kubectl exec -it pod/vault-1713784349-0 -n vault -- sh and run the command     ‘vault operator init’ to initialize the vault.

Copy these values into a hardened and secure location on your local system, they will not be output again.

Unseal the Vault: 
Then run the unseal command below until the key threshold is reached (default is 3).
--------- vault operator unseal


After the successful completion of unseal, then we are good to login into the vault using the root token.

-------  vault login


Now, we will port-forward to the Vault-UI service to access from the browser.
------ kubectl port-forward service/vault-ui 8200:8200 -n vault
