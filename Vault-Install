Install Vault in Kubernetes using Helm Charts:
--------  Helm search repo list
--------  Helm pull hashicorp/vault –untar(Pulling into our local system)

As we are deploying Vault as statefulsets, we need a storage part to persist the data. Hence, we created the storage class(ebs-sc) and modified the values.yaml accordingly.
Here,storageClass is the name of the storageClass which we created in the cluster.

To Access the Vault from browser, Modifications are needed in Values.yaml i.e “ui.enabled” should be set to ‘true’

Once Modifications are done accordingly, then we should uninstall the existing installed vault and re-install the Vault with custom modifications.
 ---------  Helm install vault -f vault/vaules.yaml -n vault --generate-name

Check the status of vault is installed or not:
 ---------- helm status vault-1713780879 -n vault (-n vault - followed by namespace)

We can validate installation by running the below command.
----------   Kubectl get all -n vault
