Enable Vault Kubernetes Authentication Method:
For Kubernetes pods to interact with Vault and get the secrets, it needs a vault token. The kubernetes auth method with the pod service account makes it easy for pods to retrieve secrets from the vault.

In this way, any pod which has been assigned the “vault” as the service account – will be able to read these secrets without requiring any vault token.

We will exec into the vault pod  to enable kubernetes authentication mode, then apply its configuration parameters.
   "Kubectl exec -it podname -n namespace – vault auth enable kubernetes"

Create a Policy
By default, the secret path has the deny policy enabled. We need to explicitly add a policy to read/write/delete the secrets.
The following policy dictates that the entity be allowed the read operation for secrets stored under “my-policy“. Execute it to create the policy
               
          """         vault policy write mypolicy - <<EOH
                   path "secret/data/webapp/config" {
                   capabilities = ["read"]
                    }
                  EOH     """

create role:
   " vault write auth/kubernetes/role/myrole policies=mypolicy ttl=15m bound_service_account_names=vault-auth bound_service_account_namespaces=vault "

This role should be assigned to service account.
