Creating Vault Secrets:

We can create secrets using CLI as well as the UI. We will use the CLI to create secrets.
To use the vault CLI, we need to exec into the vault pod.
we need to enable a path to store Vault secrets.
--- vault secrets enable -path=internal kv-v2

Create a secret in key-value format and list it. The id (key) is name and secret(value) would be username="static-user" and password="static-password". Path is secret/webapp/config

----- vault kv put secret/webapp/config foo=bar username="static-user" password="static-password‚Äù

Validate the secrets created under the path & We can check from the browser also.
-----  vault kv get secret/webapp/config
